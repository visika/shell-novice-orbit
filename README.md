shell-novice + orbit
============

This project extends the lesson on shell by Software Carpentry,
integrating a spaced repetition system to help the learner retain material after the day is over.
[Orbit](https://withorbit.com/) prompts the reader via email to come back and review what they learned after days, weeks, months.
This helps retention of concepts for a long time, hopefully forever.

An introduction to the Unix shell for people who have never used the command line before.
Please see <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/> for a rendered version of this material,
[the lesson template documentation][lesson-example]
for instructions on formatting, building, and submitting material,
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.
